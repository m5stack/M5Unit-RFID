# M5Unit - RFID

## Overview

Library for Unit-RFID using [M5UnitUnified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5UnitUnified).  
M5UnitUnified has a unified API and can control multiple units via PaHub, etc.

### SKU:U031-B

Unit RFID2 is a radio frequency identification (RFID) read/write unit based on the 13.56MHz frequency band. It integrates the WS1850S chip and complies with the ISO/IEC 14443 Type A/B standard, supporting data read/write operations for RFID cards such as MIFARE and NTAG series. The unit communicates via the I2C interface and has a read/write distance of less than 20mm.


## PICC Support

Raw R/W includes FileSystem via ISO-DEP when applicable.  
Support may be expanded in future updates to cover PICCs not listed here.

- \*1 MIFARE Plus SL3 operation has issues.

### NFC-B

**Available on UnitRFID2 (WS1850S) only.** UnitRFID (MFRC522) does NOT support NFC-B.

| PICC Type | NFC Forum Tag (NDEF) | Detect | Identify | Raw R/W | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unclassified | None | Yes | Partial | Yes | ISO-DEP transport only |

> **Note:** NFC-B is **not supported on the M5Dial builtin WS1850S**. The builtin small loop antenna cannot generate sufficient RF field for Type B PICC activation (Type B uses 10% ASK + BPSK subcarrier which is more sensitive to field strength and SNR than Type A). NFC-B requires the external **UnitRFID2** (with larger antenna).


## Emulation

Emulation is **NOT** supported on UnitRFID and UnitRFID2.

## Known Issues

- MIFARE Plus SL3 operation has issues.

### NessoN1 Connection
GROVE port (port_b) on NessoN1 uses SoftwareI2C (M5HAL Bus), which causes I2C register polling latency too high for MFRC522/WS1850S RF timing requirements.  
Use **QWIIC port (port_a)** with a QWIIC-GROVE conversion cable instead.

> **Note:** GROVE port support may be added in a future update if SoftwareI2C performance improves.

## Examples
See also [examples/UnitUnified](examples/UnitUnified)

> **Note:** The examples in this library are imported from [M5Unit-NFC](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unit-NFC) and shared between both libraries.
> The same source file supports multiple units via `#define` switches.

### For ArduinoIDE
Each example contains the following block to select the unit:

```cpp
// For UnitNFC
// #define USING_UNIT_NFC
// For CapCC1101
// #define USING_CAP_CC1101
// For UnitRFID2 (external WS1850S)
// #define USING_UNIT_RFID2
// For M5Dial built-in WS1850S
// #define USING_M5DIAL_BUILTIN_WS1850S
```

The examples are shared with [M5Unit-NFC](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unit-NFC), which is why other unit definitions exist.  
For this library, uncomment `USING_UNIT_RFID2` (external WS1850S), or `USING_M5DIAL_BUILTIN_WS1850S` for the M5Dial built-in WS1850S:

```cpp
// #define USING_UNIT_NFC
// #define USING_CAP_CC1101
#define USING_UNIT_RFID2
// #define USING_M5DIAL_BUILTIN_WS1850S
```

### For ESP-IDF settings

> **NOTE:** Works with ESP-IDF **5.x** (>=5.0), including the examples.  
> `M5Unified` / `M5GFX` (used by the examples for display output) do not yet support ESP-IDF 6.x; stay on the latest 5.x release until upstream support lands.

On ESP-IDF native builds (`idf.py`), the unit/board is selected via Kconfig instead of editing the source `#define`. Each example exposes the same choice through `main/Kconfig.projbuild`, which sources one of the family-specific Kconfig files in `examples/UnitUnified/common/`:

| Kconfig file | Variants offered | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `Kconfig.variant.full` | UnitRFID2 / M5Dial built-in WS1850S | NFC-A Detect / Dump / NDEF / PolicyOverride / ReadWrite / ValueBlock |
| `Kconfig.variant.no_dial` | UnitRFID2 | NFC-B Detect / JapanIDCard (M5Dial built-in cannot do NFC-B) |

For this library, choose **UnitRFID2** (external WS1850S) or **M5Dial built-in WS1850S**.
`examples/UnitUnified/common/variant.cmake` then maps the chosen `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_USING_*` to the source-level `USING_*` macro shared with the Arduino build.

Pick the variant with `menuconfig`:

```sh
cd examples/UnitUnified/NFCA/Detect    # or any example
idf.py set-target esp32s3              # or esp32 / esp32c6 / esp32p4 / ...
idf.py menuconfig
# -> M5Unit-RFID example -> Target unit / board -> choose ONE of the options offered
idf.py build flash monitor
```

The selected `CONFIG_EXAMPLE_USING_*` is translated into the Arduino-compatible `USING_*` macro at compile time, so the example source itself does not need to be edited.
